<p id="intro"> Almaty is the southern capital of Kazakhstan. This is a very sunny, green city, which is comfortably located at the foot of the mountains of the Trans-Ili Alatau. Almaty is not called a garden city for nothing, half of it is occupied by green spaces — poplar, oak, birch, linden, acacia, pine and spruce. A city that is beautiful in all four seasons: in spring, when everything is blooming, Almaty is especially good. White gardens cover the mountains, tulips bloom like a red carpet. In summer, the evening coolness and the breeze from the mountains, as if calling for a walk.</p>

<p> Due to its location among the mountains, this skating rink has gained worldwide fame, has become the pride of the Almaty residents. <br> Many world records have been set here. <strong> Medeo </strong> is one of the favorite places to relax on weekends. Picturesque mountains are the hallmark of Almaty. Guests and residents of the capital come here to enjoy their views by climbing the cable car to the highest point of the city of <em> Kok-Tobe</em>. It is especially beautiful here at night, when the city is illuminated by colorful lights. <br>From the high hill of Kok-Tobe, the whole city is viewed — as if the streets are lined with a ruler, dressed in greenery, bright, beautiful high-rise buildings. The Cimbulak ski base is another pearl of Almaty. There is a suspension road that will take guests to Talgar Peak.</p>
